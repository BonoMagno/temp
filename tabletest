map_slot = The slot in which the map will be placed in the map order
encounter_type = Determines wether the encounter is a Battle, an Event, or a Shop
	0x0 = to be randomized
	0x1 = always battle
	0x2 = always event
	0x3 = always shop
	0x4 = always boss
map_type = determines the map type for the map to be selected, affects the randomization when picking map id, randomized will avoid having duplicate map_types
map_id = the 0xID to be used with the change map function.
